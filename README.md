# Microservice

This repo is an example microservice architecture created with node.js and express.js. The general purpose here is just to get some practical experience writing, registering and deregistering versioned services with a service registry and using that registry with API server to successfully respond to client requests by retrieving data from each microservice.

Over time, I will add in caching and circuit breaking to make the microservices more resilient.
